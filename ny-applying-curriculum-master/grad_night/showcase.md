# Career Showcase and Grad Night

The final Thursday of our curriculum will be the night of our Career Showcase and Grad Night. You'll have a chance to demonstrate your projects in a "science fair" format for alumni and recruiters. Career Showcase is geared towards recruiters and hiring managers, which Grad Night is focused more on our alumni. While some students will receive jobs directly from these experiences, everyone has the opportunity to benefit from a friendly networking atmosphere filled with people rich in advice and knowledge about the job search.
